This is old code that I wrote while starting out on this project
It is not very good, and I did not bother to fix a lot of it, or write comments for clarity, but decided to upload it anyway.
The code is based on Sage's code, which I have not uploaded here because it is not mine, but this code was fully written by me, in order to 
be more cheap computationally, by using Xarrays rather than pkl dump files. Other than that, I also made the code more naive, but that has
more to do with my lack of experience than any fault of Sage, who wrote much better code...
