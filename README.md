# Driftwave_Persistence_Code
Code written in order to calculate and visualize topological persistence data from Hasegawa-Wakatani model driftwaves both in 2D and in 3D

Currently going through a large rewrite/restructure

Deprecated is all code that was once part of this project that no longer is in use. The current project really is to use MethodsMaster as a library of methods to do the Driftwaver Persistence necklace
